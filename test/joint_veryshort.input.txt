the twenty-seven-year-old man died of four gunshot wounds.	three of the seals being rescued were also killed and the fourth wounded.

the only people that can afford it are the super rich...	he got bin laden from a place that bush didn't dare to go into.
it's a pretty far-fetched argument, just like those that argue that god or satan made me do it.	it is a pretty sad statement of the times, imo, that things have gotten so bad.
